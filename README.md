# Hazard_Bot_run
 This is a game where a bot need to escape from the rooms or levels to save his life. I have made 3 levels of the game. I created the animation and the model by myself. 
 
 For playing the game I have provided the WebGL build in the builds folder or one can also play the game by importing the full package into unity from the package folder.
 
 Here is a gameplay video.
